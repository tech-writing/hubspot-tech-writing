    "post_body": "<p>Welcome to part 1 of our blog series on \"Running Time Series Models in Production using CrateDB\".</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>In this blog post, we will introduce you to the concept of time series&nbsp;modeling, and discuss the main obstacles faced during its implementation in production. We will then introduce you to CrateDB, highlighting its key features and benefits, why it stands out in <a href=\"/solutions/time-series-database\" rel=\"noopener\">managing time series data</a>, and why it is an especially good fit for supporting machine learning models in production.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a data scientist aiming to simplify your model deployment, a data engineer looking to enhance your data landscape, or a tech enthusiast keen on understanding the latest trends, this blog post will offer valuable insights and practical knowledge.</p>\n<p>For readers familiar with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling\" rel=\"noopener\">data modeling,</a> it is important to distinguish that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#Models\" rel=\"noopener\">time series modeling</a> is a different discipline.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Time Series Modeling</h3>\n<p>Time series modeling is a crucial technique used across various sectors. Two main modeling techniques comprise the field of machine learning: Time series forecasting and anomaly detection.</p>\n<p>Time series forecasting has applications in predicting future sales in retail, anticipating stock market trends in finance, predictive maintenance in manufacturing, user churn and subscription analysis in web applications, forecasting energy demand in utilities, and many others. It involves the use of statistical models to predict future values based on previously observed data.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Anomaly Detection</h3>\n<p>Anomaly detection is used to identify outliers or unusual patterns in time series data. This detection technique uses statistical and machine learning algorithms to sift through large data sets over specific time intervals, analyzing patterns, trends, cycles, or seasonality, to spot deviations from the norm. These anomalies could either be an error or indicate another kind of significant event you would like to be alerted about.</p>\n<p>Anomaly detection is widely used in multiple fields and industries, including cybersecurity, where it identifies unusual network activity patterns that could signify a potential breach, in finance for spotting fraudulent activities in credit card transactions; and in IoT for detecting malfunctioning sensors and machines. Other use cases include healthcare, for monitoring unusual patient vital signs, and predictive maintenance, where it is used to identify abnormal machine behavior, in order to prevent system failures.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">CrateDB: the perfect fit for time series data</h3>\n<p>While creating these models in itself is a challenging task, deploying them to production environments in a robust manner, is often equally challenging. More often than not, you will need to deal with large volumes of data, ensure real-time processing, manage and update feature stores, keep track of data and model versions, all while maintaining data accuracy and integrity.</p>\n<p>This is where CrateDB comes into play. CrateDB is a <a href=\"/product/features/distributed-database\" rel=\"noopener\">distributed SQL database</a>, designed specifically to handle the unique demands of <a href=\"/solutions/time-series-database\" rel=\"noopener\">time series data</a>. It offers <a href=\"/product/features/speed-and-scalability\" rel=\"noopener\">scalability</a>, real-time data processing, and ease of use, making it an ideal choice for deploying time series and anomaly detection models. On top of that, CrateDB offers first-class analytical SQL support for time series data and binary blob data types, which makes it possible to store and retrieve machine learning models without needing extra infrastructure.</p>\n<p>CrateDB is well integrated with the modern data processing and machine learning ecosystem through both its <a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">SQLAlchemy </a>dialect and its <a href=\"/product/features/postgresql-wire-protocol\" rel=\"noopener\">PostgreSQL</a> wire-protocol compatibility. It provides support and adapters for <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Flink</a>, <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Kafka</a>, <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Spark</a>, <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">pandas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dask.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Dask</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/crate/ml-sandbox/blob/main/timeseries-data/article/01-about-intro.md#:~:text=as%20well%20as-,Apache%20Superset,-%2C%20Tableau%2C%20and\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Superset</a>, <a href=\"https://crate.io/docs/crate/clients-tools/en/latest/integrate/analyze.html#business-intelligence-with-tableau\" rel=\"noopener\">Tableau</a>, and <a href=\"https://crate.io/partners/technology-partners\" rel=\"noopener\">many more</a>.</p>\n<h2>Time Series&nbsp;Modeling</h2>\n<p>Time series modeling is a statistical technique that utilizes sequential data to predict future values or events based on historical data. It involves analyzing patterns, trends, and seasonality in past data, to forecast future events. This type of forecasting is particularly useful when dealing with data that changes over time, such as stock prices, weather patterns, marketing &amp; sales data, or M2M/IoT data.</p>\n<p>One of the key components of time series modeling is the understanding and interpretation of certain critical properties intrinsic to time series data, such as trend, seasonality, and cyclicality. Trend refers to the overall pattern or direction in which data is moving over a significant period. Seasonality are the recurring patterns or cycles that are typically observed within a specific time frame, be it daily, weekly, annually, etc. Cyclicality involves fluctuations that occur at irregular intervals, and cannot be linked to any particular season or event.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Applications</h3>\n<p>The ability to accurately predict future events based on past data is invaluable in many sectors. For instance, online shops can forecast product demand to manage inventory, financial institutions can predict stock prices to make informed investment decisions, and manufacturing companies can anticipate machine maintenance downtimes to efficiently plan their production schedules. By making accurate predictions, businesses can make predictive, data-based decisions, reduce risks, and improve efficiency.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, time series modeling is also useful for anomaly detection. Anomalies are data points that deviate from the expected pattern or trend. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as human error, equipment malfunction, or cyber-attacks. By detecting anomalies early on, businesses can take corrective actions to prevent further damage. For instance, a manufacturing company can detect anomalies in their production process to prevent machine breakdowns and avoid costly downtimes.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Technical Background</h3>\n<p>Various types of models are employed in time series analysis, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The simplest model is the autoregressive (AR) model, which assumes future values can be forecasted from a weighted sum of the past. The moving average (MA) model, on the other hand, assumes that future values are a function of the mean and various random error terms. More complex models, like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), combine strategies from AR and MA models while also accounting for trends and seasonality. Additionally, state-of-the-art models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, are effective at capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.</p>\n<p>More recent models for anomaly detection are Random Cut Forest (RCF), Variational Auto Encoders (VAE), which are both neural network-based, unsupervised learning algorithms (with VAEs surprisingly being also very good in semi-supervised and supervised learning applications). Honorable mentions in the field of time series anomaly detection are also the Isolation Forest (IF), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) models, and the excellent prophet time series analysis library released by Facebook.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, recent developments advise to not only use a single model for time series forecasting and anomaly detection, but multiple ones, called an ensemble. This technique uses multiple of the aforementioned models on the same data, and then combines their predictions to get a more accurate result.To get a practical hang of how time series modeling works, the next section will exercise a basic example.</p>\n<h2>Example: Times Series Anomaly Detection for Machine Data</h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Prologue</h3>\n<p>NOTE: While this example should provide more depth to understanding time series modeling, it is not intended to teach the foundations of this field of data science. Instead, it will focus more on how to use machine learning models in production scenarios. However, if you are interested in learning more about time series modeling, we recommend to check out <a href=\"https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/time-series-analysis-python/\" rel=\"noopener\">Time Series Analysis in Python – A Comprehensive Guide with Examples, </a>by Selva Prabhakaran.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">About</h3>\n<p>The exercise will use the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) dataset, which includes real-world and artificial time series data for anomaly detection research. We will choose the dataset about real measured temperature readings from a machine room. The goal is to detect anomalies in the temperature readings, which could indicate a malfunctioning machine. The dataset simulates machine temperature measurements, and will be loaded into CrateDB upfront.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Setup</h3>\n<p>To follow this tutorial, load the <a href=\"https://github.com/numenta/NAB/raw/master/data/realKnownCause/machine_temperature_system_failure.csv\" rel=\"noopener\">machine_temperature_system_failure.csv</a> into your <a href=\"https://crate.io/products/cratedb-cloud\" rel=\"noopener\">CrateDB Cloud</a> cluster.

We will then introduce you to CrateDB, highlighting its key features and benefits, why it stands out in <a href=\"/solutions/time-series-database\" rel=\"noopener\">managing time series data</a>, and why it is an especially good fit for supporting machine learning models in production.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a data scientist aiming to simplify your model deployment, a data engineer looking to enhance your data landscape, or a tech enthusiast keen on understanding the latest trends, this blog post will offer valuable insights and practical knowledge.</p>\n<p>For readers familiar with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling\" rel=\"noopener\">data modeling,</a> it is important to distinguish that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#Models\" rel=\"noopener\">time series modeling</a> is a different discipline.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Time Series Modeling</h3>\n<p>Time series modeling is a crucial technique used across various sectors. Two main modeling techniques comprise the field of machine learning: Time series forecasting and anomaly detection.</p>\n<p>Time series forecasting has applications in predicting future sales in retail, anticipating stock market trends in finance, predictive maintenance in manufacturing, user churn and subscription analysis in web applications, forecasting energy demand in utilities, and many others. It involves the use of statistical models to predict future values based on previously observed data.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Anomaly Detection</h3>\n<p>Anomaly detection is used to identify outliers or unusual patterns in time series data. This detection technique uses statistical and machine learning algorithms to sift through large data sets over specific time intervals, analyzing patterns, trends, cycles, or seasonality, to spot deviations from the norm. These anomalies could either be an error or indicate another kind of significant event you would like to be alerted about.</p>\n<p>Anomaly detection is widely used in multiple fields and industries, including cybersecurity, where it identifies unusual network activity patterns that could signify a potential breach, in finance for spotting fraudulent activities in credit card transactions; and in IoT for detecting malfunctioning sensors and machines. Other use cases include healthcare, for monitoring unusual patient vital signs, and predictive maintenance, where it is used to identify abnormal machine behavior, in order to prevent system failures.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">CrateDB: the perfect fit for time series data</h3>\n<p>While creating these models in itself is a challenging task, deploying them to production environments in a robust manner, is often equally challenging. More often than not, you will need to deal with large volumes of data, ensure real-time processing, manage and update feature stores, keep track of data and model versions, all while maintaining data accuracy and integrity.</p>\n<p>This is where CrateDB comes into play. CrateDB is a <a href=\"/product/features/distributed-database\" rel=\"noopener\">distributed SQL database</a>, designed specifically to handle the unique demands of <a href=\"/solutions/time-series-database\" rel=\"noopener\">time series data</a>. It offers <a href=\"/product/features/speed-and-scalability\" rel=\"noopener\">scalability</a>, real-time data processing, and ease of use, making it an ideal choice for deploying time series and anomaly detection models. On top of that, CrateDB offers first-class analytical SQL support for time series data and binary blob data types, which makes it possible to store and retrieve machine learning models without needing extra infrastructure.</p>\n<p>CrateDB is well integrated with the modern data processing and machine learning ecosystem through both its <a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">SQLAlchemy </a>dialect and its <a href=\"/product/features/postgresql-wire-protocol\" rel=\"noopener\">PostgreSQL</a> wire-protocol compatibility. It provides support and adapters for <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Flink</a>, <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Kafka</a>, <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Spark</a>, <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">pandas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dask.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Dask</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/crate/ml-sandbox/blob/main/timeseries-data/article/01-about-intro.md#:~:text=as%20well%20as-,Apache%20Superset,-%2C%20Tableau%2C%20and\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Superset</a>, <a href=\"https://crate.io/docs/crate/clients-tools/en/latest/integrate/analyze.html#business-intelligence-with-tableau\" rel=\"noopener\">Tableau</a>, and <a href=\"https://crate.io/partners/technology-partners\" rel=\"noopener\">many more</a>.</p>\n<h2>Time Series&nbsp;Modeling</h2>\n<p>Time series modeling is a statistical technique that utilizes sequential data to predict future values or events based on historical data. It involves analyzing patterns, trends, and seasonality in past data, to forecast future events. This type of forecasting is particularly useful when dealing with data that changes over time, such as stock prices, weather patterns, marketing &amp; sales data, or M2M/IoT data.</p>\n<p>One of the key components of time series modeling is the understanding and interpretation of certain critical properties intrinsic to time series data, such as trend, seasonality, and cyclicality. Trend refers to the overall pattern or direction in which data is moving over a significant period. Seasonality are the recurring patterns or cycles that are typically observed within a specific time frame, be it daily, weekly, annually, etc. Cyclicality involves fluctuations that occur at irregular intervals, and cannot be linked to any particular season or event.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Applications</h3>\n<p>The ability to accurately predict future events based on past data is invaluable in many sectors. For instance, online shops can forecast product demand to manage inventory, financial institutions can predict stock prices to make informed investment decisions, and manufacturing companies can anticipate machine maintenance downtimes to efficiently plan their production schedules. By making accurate predictions, businesses can make predictive, data-based decisions, reduce risks, and improve efficiency.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, time series modeling is also useful for anomaly detection. Anomalies are data points that deviate from the expected pattern or trend. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as human error, equipment malfunction, or cyber-attacks. By detecting anomalies early on, businesses can take corrective actions to prevent further damage. For instance, a manufacturing company can detect anomalies in their production process to prevent machine breakdowns and avoid costly downtimes.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Technical Background</h3>\n<p>Various types of models are employed in time series analysis, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The simplest model is the autoregressive (AR) model, which assumes future values can be forecasted from a weighted sum of the past. The moving average (MA) model, on the other hand, assumes that future values are a function of the mean and various random error terms. More complex models, like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), combine strategies from AR and MA models while also accounting for trends and seasonality. Additionally, state-of-the-art models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, are effective at capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.</p>\n<p>More recent models for anomaly detection are Random Cut Forest (RCF), Variational Auto Encoders (VAE), which are both neural network-based, unsupervised learning algorithms (with VAEs surprisingly being also very good in semi-supervised and supervised learning applications). Honorable mentions in the field of time series anomaly detection are also the Isolation Forest (IF), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) models, and the excellent prophet time series analysis library released by Facebook.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, recent developments advise to not only use a single model for time series forecasting and anomaly detection, but multiple ones, called an ensemble. This technique uses multiple of the aforementioned models on the same data, and then combines their predictions to get a more accurate result.To get a practical hang of how time series modeling works, the next section will exercise a basic example.</p>\n<h2>Example: Times Series Anomaly Detection for Machine Data</h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Prologue</h3>\n<p>NOTE: While this example should provide more depth to understanding time series modeling, it is not intended to teach the foundations of this field of data science. Instead, it will focus more on how to use machine learning models in production scenarios.

It supports various time series learning tasks, including forecasting, anomaly detection, and change point detection.<br><br>Start by first splitting the dataset into training and test data. The exercise will use unsupervised learning, so you want to train the model on data without anomalies, and then check whether it is able to detect the anomalies in the test data.

  "postBody": "<p>Welcome to part 1 of our blog series on \"Running Time Series Models in Production using CrateDB\".</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>In this blog post, we will introduce you to the concept of time series&nbsp;modeling, and discuss the main obstacles faced during its implementation in production. We will then introduce you to CrateDB, highlighting its key features and benefits, why it stands out in <a href=\"/solutions/time-series-database\" rel=\"noopener\">managing time series data</a>, and why it is an especially good fit for supporting machine learning models in production.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a data scientist aiming to simplify your model deployment, a data engineer looking to enhance your data landscape, or a tech enthusiast keen on understanding the latest trends, this blog post will offer valuable insights and practical knowledge.</p>\n<p>For readers familiar with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling\" rel=\"noopener\">data modeling,</a> it is important to distinguish that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#Models\" rel=\"noopener\">time series modeling</a> is a different discipline.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Time Series Modeling</h3>\n<p>Time series modeling is a crucial technique used across various sectors. Two main modeling techniques comprise the field of machine learning: Time series forecasting and anomaly detection.</p>\n<p>Time series forecasting has applications in predicting future sales in retail, anticipating stock market trends in finance, predictive maintenance in manufacturing, user churn and subscription analysis in web applications, forecasting energy demand in utilities, and many others. It involves the use of statistical models to predict future values based on previously observed data.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Anomaly Detection</h3>\n<p>Anomaly detection is used to identify outliers or unusual patterns in time series data. This detection technique uses statistical and machine learning algorithms to sift through large data sets over specific time intervals, analyzing patterns, trends, cycles, or seasonality, to spot deviations from the norm. These anomalies could either be an error or indicate another kind of significant event you would like to be alerted about.</p>\n<p>Anomaly detection is widely used in multiple fields and industries, including cybersecurity, where it identifies unusual network activity patterns that could signify a potential breach, in finance for spotting fraudulent activities in credit card transactions; and in IoT for detecting malfunctioning sensors and machines. Other use cases include healthcare, for monitoring unusual patient vital signs, and predictive maintenance, where it is used to identify abnormal machine behavior, in order to prevent system failures.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">CrateDB: the perfect fit for time series data</h3>\n<p>While creating these models in itself is a challenging task, deploying them to production environments in a robust manner, is often equally challenging. More often than not, you will need to deal with large volumes of data, ensure real-time processing, manage and update feature stores, keep track of data and model versions, all while maintaining data accuracy and integrity.</p>\n<p>This is where CrateDB comes into play. CrateDB is a <a href=\"/product/features/distributed-database\" rel=\"noopener\">distributed SQL database</a>, designed specifically to handle the unique demands of <a href=\"/solutions/time-series-database\" rel=\"noopener\">time series data</a>. It offers <a href=\"/product/features/speed-and-scalability\" rel=\"noopener\">scalability</a>, real-time data processing, and ease of use, making it an ideal choice for deploying time series and anomaly detection models. On top of that, CrateDB offers first-class analytical SQL support for time series data and binary blob data types, which makes it possible to store and retrieve machine learning models without needing extra infrastructure.</p>\n<p>CrateDB is well integrated with the modern data processing and machine learning ecosystem through both its <a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">SQLAlchemy </a>dialect and its <a href=\"/product/features/postgresql-wire-protocol\" rel=\"noopener\">PostgreSQL</a> wire-protocol compatibility. It provides support and adapters for <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Flink</a>, <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Kafka</a>, <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Spark</a>, <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">pandas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dask.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Dask</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/crate/ml-sandbox/blob/main/timeseries-data/article/01-about-intro.md#:~:text=as%20well%20as-,Apache%20Superset,-%2C%20Tableau%2C%20and\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Superset</a>, <a href=\"https://crate.io/docs/crate/clients-tools/en/latest/integrate/analyze.html#business-intelligence-with-tableau\" rel=\"noopener\">Tableau</a>, and <a href=\"https://crate.io/partners/technology-partners\" rel=\"noopener\">many more</a>.</p>\n<h2>Time Series&nbsp;Modeling</h2>\n<p>Time series modeling is a statistical technique that utilizes sequential data to predict future values or events based on historical data. It involves analyzing patterns, trends, and seasonality in past data, to forecast future events. This type of forecasting is particularly useful when dealing with data that changes over time, such as stock prices, weather patterns, marketing &amp; sales data, or M2M/IoT data.</p>\n<p>One of the key components of time series modeling is the understanding and interpretation of certain critical properties intrinsic to time series data, such as trend, seasonality, and cyclicality. Trend refers to the overall pattern or direction in which data is moving over a significant period. Seasonality are the recurring patterns or cycles that are typically observed within a specific time frame, be it daily, weekly, annually, etc. Cyclicality involves fluctuations that occur at irregular intervals, and cannot be linked to any particular season or event.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Applications</h3>\n<p>The ability to accurately predict future events based on past data is invaluable in many sectors. For instance, online shops can forecast product demand to manage inventory, financial institutions can predict stock prices to make informed investment decisions, and manufacturing companies can anticipate machine maintenance downtimes to efficiently plan their production schedules. By making accurate predictions, businesses can make predictive, data-based decisions, reduce risks, and improve efficiency.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, time series modeling is also useful for anomaly detection. Anomalies are data points that deviate from the expected pattern or trend. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as human error, equipment malfunction, or cyber-attacks. By detecting anomalies early on, businesses can take corrective actions to prevent further damage. For instance, a manufacturing company can detect anomalies in their production process to prevent machine breakdowns and avoid costly downtimes.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Technical Background</h3>\n<p>Various types of models are employed in time series analysis, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The simplest model is the autoregressive (AR) model, which assumes future values can be forecasted from a weighted sum of the past. The moving average (MA) model, on the other hand, assumes that future values are a function of the mean and various random error terms. More complex models, like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), combine strategies from AR and MA models while also accounting for trends and seasonality. Additionally, state-of-the-art models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, are effective at capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.</p>\n<p>More recent models for anomaly detection are Random Cut Forest (RCF), Variational Auto Encoders (VAE), which are both neural network-based, unsupervised learning algorithms (with VAEs surprisingly being also very good in semi-supervised and supervised learning applications). Honorable mentions in the field of time series anomaly detection are also the Isolation Forest (IF), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) models, and the excellent prophet time series analysis library released by Facebook.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, recent developments advise to not only use a single model for time series forecasting and anomaly detection, but multiple ones, called an ensemble. This technique uses multiple of the aforementioned models on the same data, and then combines their predictions to get a more accurate result.To get a practical hang of how time series modeling works, the next section will exercise a basic example.</p>\n<h2>Example: Times Series Anomaly Detection for Machine Data</h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Prologue</h3>\n<p>NOTE: While this example should provide more depth to understanding time series modeling, it is not intended to teach the foundations of this field of data science. Instead, it will focus more on how to use machine learning models in production scenarios. However, if you are interested in learning more about time series modeling, we recommend to check out <a href=\"https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/time-series-analysis-python/\" rel=\"noopener\">Time Series Analysis in Python – A Comprehensive Guide with Examples, </a>by Selva Prabhakaran.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">About</h3>\n<p>The exercise will use the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) dataset, which includes real-world and artificial time series data for anomaly detection research. We will choose the dataset about real measured temperature readings from a machine room. The goal is to detect anomalies in the temperature readings, which could indicate a malfunctioning machine. The dataset simulates machine temperature measurements, and will be loaded into CrateDB upfront.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Setup</h3>\n<p>To follow this tutorial, load the <a href=\"https://github.com/numenta/NAB/raw/master/data/realKnownCause/machine_temperature_system_failure.csv\" rel=\"noopener\">machine_temperature_system_failure.csv</a> into your <a href=\"https://crate.io/products/cratedb-cloud\" rel=\"noopener\">CrateDB Cloud</a> cluster.

We will then introduce you to CrateDB, highlighting its key features and benefits, why it stands out in <a href=\"/solutions/time-series-database\" rel=\"noopener\">managing time series data</a>, and why it is an especially good fit for supporting machine learning models in production.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a data scientist aiming to simplify your model deployment, a data engineer looking to enhance your data landscape, or a tech enthusiast keen on understanding the latest trends, this blog post will offer valuable insights and practical knowledge.</p>\n<p>For readers familiar with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling\" rel=\"noopener\">data modeling,</a> it is important to distinguish that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#Models\" rel=\"noopener\">time series modeling</a> is a different discipline.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Time Series Modeling</h3>\n<p>Time series modeling is a crucial technique used across various sectors. Two main modeling techniques comprise the field of machine learning: Time series forecasting and anomaly detection.</p>\n<p>Time series forecasting has applications in predicting future sales in retail, anticipating stock market trends in finance, predictive maintenance in manufacturing, user churn and subscription analysis in web applications, forecasting energy demand in utilities, and many others. It involves the use of statistical models to predict future values based on previously observed data.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Anomaly Detection</h3>\n<p>Anomaly detection is used to identify outliers or unusual patterns in time series data. This detection technique uses statistical and machine learning algorithms to sift through large data sets over specific time intervals, analyzing patterns, trends, cycles, or seasonality, to spot deviations from the norm. These anomalies could either be an error or indicate another kind of significant event you would like to be alerted about.</p>\n<p>Anomaly detection is widely used in multiple fields and industries, including cybersecurity, where it identifies unusual network activity patterns that could signify a potential breach, in finance for spotting fraudulent activities in credit card transactions; and in IoT for detecting malfunctioning sensors and machines. Other use cases include healthcare, for monitoring unusual patient vital signs, and predictive maintenance, where it is used to identify abnormal machine behavior, in order to prevent system failures.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">CrateDB: the perfect fit for time series data</h3>\n<p>While creating these models in itself is a challenging task, deploying them to production environments in a robust manner, is often equally challenging. More often than not, you will need to deal with large volumes of data, ensure real-time processing, manage and update feature stores, keep track of data and model versions, all while maintaining data accuracy and integrity.</p>\n<p>This is where CrateDB comes into play. CrateDB is a <a href=\"/product/features/distributed-database\" rel=\"noopener\">distributed SQL database</a>, designed specifically to handle the unique demands of <a href=\"/solutions/time-series-database\" rel=\"noopener\">time series data</a>. It offers <a href=\"/product/features/speed-and-scalability\" rel=\"noopener\">scalability</a>, real-time data processing, and ease of use, making it an ideal choice for deploying time series and anomaly detection models. On top of that, CrateDB offers first-class analytical SQL support for time series data and binary blob data types, which makes it possible to store and retrieve machine learning models without needing extra infrastructure.</p>\n<p>CrateDB is well integrated with the modern data processing and machine learning ecosystem through both its <a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">SQLAlchemy </a>dialect and its <a href=\"/product/features/postgresql-wire-protocol\" rel=\"noopener\">PostgreSQL</a> wire-protocol compatibility. It provides support and adapters for <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Flink</a>, <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Kafka</a>, <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Spark</a>, <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">pandas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dask.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Dask</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/crate/ml-sandbox/blob/main/timeseries-data/article/01-about-intro.md#:~:text=as%20well%20as-,Apache%20Superset,-%2C%20Tableau%2C%20and\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Superset</a>, <a href=\"https://crate.io/docs/crate/clients-tools/en/latest/integrate/analyze.html#business-intelligence-with-tableau\" rel=\"noopener\">Tableau</a>, and <a href=\"https://crate.io/partners/technology-partners\" rel=\"noopener\">many more</a>.</p>\n<h2>Time Series&nbsp;Modeling</h2>\n<p>Time series modeling is a statistical technique that utilizes sequential data to predict future values or events based on historical data. It involves analyzing patterns, trends, and seasonality in past data, to forecast future events. This type of forecasting is particularly useful when dealing with data that changes over time, such as stock prices, weather patterns, marketing &amp; sales data, or M2M/IoT data.</p>\n<p>One of the key components of time series modeling is the understanding and interpretation of certain critical properties intrinsic to time series data, such as trend, seasonality, and cyclicality. Trend refers to the overall pattern or direction in which data is moving over a significant period. Seasonality are the recurring patterns or cycles that are typically observed within a specific time frame, be it daily, weekly, annually, etc. Cyclicality involves fluctuations that occur at irregular intervals, and cannot be linked to any particular season or event.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Applications</h3>\n<p>The ability to accurately predict future events based on past data is invaluable in many sectors. For instance, online shops can forecast product demand to manage inventory, financial institutions can predict stock prices to make informed investment decisions, and manufacturing companies can anticipate machine maintenance downtimes to efficiently plan their production schedules. By making accurate predictions, businesses can make predictive, data-based decisions, reduce risks, and improve efficiency.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, time series modeling is also useful for anomaly detection. Anomalies are data points that deviate from the expected pattern or trend. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as human error, equipment malfunction, or cyber-attacks. By detecting anomalies early on, businesses can take corrective actions to prevent further damage. For instance, a manufacturing company can detect anomalies in their production process to prevent machine breakdowns and avoid costly downtimes.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Technical Background</h3>\n<p>Various types of models are employed in time series analysis, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The simplest model is the autoregressive (AR) model, which assumes future values can be forecasted from a weighted sum of the past. The moving average (MA) model, on the other hand, assumes that future values are a function of the mean and various random error terms. More complex models, like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), combine strategies from AR and MA models while also accounting for trends and seasonality. Additionally, state-of-the-art models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, are effective at capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.</p>\n<p>More recent models for anomaly detection are Random Cut Forest (RCF), Variational Auto Encoders (VAE), which are both neural network-based, unsupervised learning algorithms (with VAEs surprisingly being also very good in semi-supervised and supervised learning applications). Honorable mentions in the field of time series anomaly detection are also the Isolation Forest (IF), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) models, and the excellent prophet time series analysis library released by Facebook.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, recent developments advise to not only use a single model for time series forecasting and anomaly detection, but multiple ones, called an ensemble. This technique uses multiple of the aforementioned models on the same data, and then combines their predictions to get a more accurate result.To get a practical hang of how time series modeling works, the next section will exercise a basic example.</p>\n<h2>Example: Times Series Anomaly Detection for Machine Data</h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Prologue</h3>\n<p>NOTE: While this example should provide more depth to understanding time series modeling, it is not intended to teach the foundations of this field of data science. Instead, it will focus more on how to use machine learning models in production scenarios. However, if you are interested in learning more about time series modeling, we recommend to check out <a href=\"https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/time-series-analysis-python/\" rel=\"noopener\">Time Series Analysis in Python – A Comprehensive Guide with Examples, </a>by Selva Prabhakaran.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">About</h3>\n<p>The exercise will use the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) dataset, which includes real-world and artificial time series data for anomaly detection research. We will choose the dataset about real measured temperature readings from a machine room. The goal is to detect anomalies in the temperature readings, which could indicate a malfunctioning machine. The dataset simulates machine temperature measurements, and will be loaded into CrateDB upfront.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Setup</h3>\n<p>To follow this tutorial, load the <a href=\"https://github.com/numenta/NAB/raw/master/data/realKnownCause/machine_temperature_system_failure.csv\" rel=\"noopener\">machine_temperature_system_failure.csv</a> into your <a href=\"https://crate.io/products/cratedb-cloud\" rel=\"noopener\">CrateDB Cloud</a> cluster.

As mentioned in the introduction, there are a multitude of options to choose from. This post will not go into the very details of model selection, and will just use the <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/Merlion\" rel=\"noopener\">Merlion</a> library, an excellent open-source time series analysis package developed by Salesforce.<br><br>Merlion implements an end-to-end machine learning framework, that includes loading and transforming data, building and training models, post-processing model outputs, and evaluating model performance.

We will then introduce you to CrateDB, highlighting its key features and benefits, why it stands out in <a href=\"/solutions/time-series-database\" rel=\"noopener\">managing time series data</a>, and why it is an especially good fit for supporting machine learning models in production.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a data scientist aiming to simplify your model deployment, a data engineer looking to enhance your data landscape, or a tech enthusiast keen on understanding the latest trends, this blog post will offer valuable insights and practical knowledge.</p>\n<p>For readers familiar with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling\" rel=\"noopener\">data modeling,</a> it is important to distinguish that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series#Models\" rel=\"noopener\">time series modeling</a> is a different discipline.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Time Series Modeling</h3>\n<p>Time series modeling is a crucial technique used across various sectors. Two main modeling techniques comprise the field of machine learning: Time series forecasting and anomaly detection.</p>\n<p>Time series forecasting has applications in predicting future sales in retail, anticipating stock market trends in finance, predictive maintenance in manufacturing, user churn and subscription analysis in web applications, forecasting energy demand in utilities, and many others. It involves the use of statistical models to predict future values based on previously observed data.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Anomaly Detection</h3>\n<p>Anomaly detection is used to identify outliers or unusual patterns in time series data. This detection technique uses statistical and machine learning algorithms to sift through large data sets over specific time intervals, analyzing patterns, trends, cycles, or seasonality, to spot deviations from the norm. These anomalies could either be an error or indicate another kind of significant event you would like to be alerted about.</p>\n<p>Anomaly detection is widely used in multiple fields and industries, including cybersecurity, where it identifies unusual network activity patterns that could signify a potential breach, in finance for spotting fraudulent activities in credit card transactions; and in IoT for detecting malfunctioning sensors and machines. Other use cases include healthcare, for monitoring unusual patient vital signs, and predictive maintenance, where it is used to identify abnormal machine behavior, in order to prevent system failures.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">CrateDB: the perfect fit for time series data</h3>\n<p>While creating these models in itself is a challenging task, deploying them to production environments in a robust manner, is often equally challenging. More often than not, you will need to deal with large volumes of data, ensure real-time processing, manage and update feature stores, keep track of data and model versions, all while maintaining data accuracy and integrity.</p>\n<p>This is where CrateDB comes into play. CrateDB is a <a href=\"/product/features/distributed-database\" rel=\"noopener\">distributed SQL database</a>, designed specifically to handle the unique demands of <a href=\"/solutions/time-series-database\" rel=\"noopener\">time series data</a>. It offers <a href=\"/product/features/speed-and-scalability\" rel=\"noopener\">scalability</a>, real-time data processing, and ease of use, making it an ideal choice for deploying time series and anomaly detection models. On top of that, CrateDB offers first-class analytical SQL support for time series data and binary blob data types, which makes it possible to store and retrieve machine learning models without needing extra infrastructure.</p>\n<p>CrateDB is well integrated with the modern data processing and machine learning ecosystem through both its <a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">SQLAlchemy </a>dialect and its <a href=\"/product/features/postgresql-wire-protocol\" rel=\"noopener\">PostgreSQL</a> wire-protocol compatibility. It provides support and adapters for <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Flink</a>, <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Kafka</a>, <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Spark</a>, <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">pandas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dask.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Dask</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/crate/ml-sandbox/blob/main/timeseries-data/article/01-about-intro.md#:~:text=as%20well%20as-,Apache%20Superset,-%2C%20Tableau%2C%20and\" rel=\"noopener\">Apache Superset</a>, <a href=\"https://crate.io/docs/crate/clients-tools/en/latest/integrate/analyze.html#business-intelligence-with-tableau\" rel=\"noopener\">Tableau</a>, and <a href=\"https://crate.io/partners/technology-partners\" rel=\"noopener\">many more</a>.</p>\n<h2>Time Series&nbsp;Modeling</h2>\n<p>Time series modeling is a statistical technique that utilizes sequential data to predict future values or events based on historical data. It involves analyzing patterns, trends, and seasonality in past data, to forecast future events. This type of forecasting is particularly useful when dealing with data that changes over time, such as stock prices, weather patterns, marketing &amp; sales data, or M2M/IoT data.</p>\n<p>One of the key components of time series modeling is the understanding and interpretation of certain critical properties intrinsic to time series data, such as trend, seasonality, and cyclicality. Trend refers to the overall pattern or direction in which data is moving over a significant period. Seasonality are the recurring patterns or cycles that are typically observed within a specific time frame, be it daily, weekly, annually, etc. Cyclicality involves fluctuations that occur at irregular intervals, and cannot be linked to any particular season or event.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Applications</h3>\n<p>The ability to accurately predict future events based on past data is invaluable in many sectors. For instance, online shops can forecast product demand to manage inventory, financial institutions can predict stock prices to make informed investment decisions, and manufacturing companies can anticipate machine maintenance downtimes to efficiently plan their production schedules. By making accurate predictions, businesses can make predictive, data-based decisions, reduce risks, and improve efficiency.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, time series modeling is also useful for anomaly detection. Anomalies are data points that deviate from the expected pattern or trend. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as human error, equipment malfunction, or cyber-attacks. By detecting anomalies early on, businesses can take corrective actions to prevent further damage. For instance, a manufacturing company can detect anomalies in their production process to prevent machine breakdowns and avoid costly downtimes.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Technical Background</h3>\n<p>Various types of models are employed in time series analysis, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The simplest model is the autoregressive (AR) model, which assumes future values can be forecasted from a weighted sum of the past. The moving average (MA) model, on the other hand, assumes that future values are a function of the mean and various random error terms. More complex models, like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), combine strategies from AR and MA models while also accounting for trends and seasonality. Additionally, state-of-the-art models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, are effective at capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.</p>\n<p>More recent models for anomaly detection are Random Cut Forest (RCF), Variational Auto Encoders (VAE), which are both neural network-based, unsupervised learning algorithms (with VAEs surprisingly being also very good in semi-supervised and supervised learning applications). Honorable mentions in the field of time series anomaly detection are also the Isolation Forest (IF), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) models, and the excellent prophet time series analysis library released by Facebook.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, recent developments advise to not only use a single model for time series forecasting and anomaly detection, but multiple ones, called an ensemble. This technique uses multiple of the aforementioned models on the same data, and then combines their predictions to get a more accurate result.To get a practical hang of how time series modeling works, the next section will exercise a basic example.</p>\n<h2>Example: Times Series Anomaly Detection for Machine Data</h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Prologue</h3>\n<p>NOTE: While this example should provide more depth to understanding time series modeling, it is not intended to teach the foundations of this field of data science. Instead, it will focus more on how to use machine learning models in production scenarios. However, if you are interested in learning more about time series modeling, we recommend to check out <a href=\"https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/time-series-analysis-python/\" rel=\"noopener\">Time Series Analysis in Python – A Comprehensive Guide with Examples, </a>by Selva Prabhakaran.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">About</h3>\n<p>The exercise will use the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) dataset, which includes real-world and artificial time series data for anomaly detection research. We will choose the dataset about real measured temperature readings from a machine room. The goal is to detect anomalies in the temperature readings, which could indicate a malfunctioning machine. The dataset simulates machine temperature measurements, and will be loaded into CrateDB upfront.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">Setup</h3>\n<p>To follow this tutorial, load the <a href=\"https://github.com/numenta/NAB/raw/master/data/realKnownCause/machine_temperature_system_failure.csv\" rel=\"noopener\">machine_temperature_system_failure.csv</a> into your <a href=\"https://crate.io/products/cratedb-cloud\" rel=\"noopener\">CrateDB Cloud</a> cluster.

As mentioned in the introduction, there are a multitude of options to choose from. This post will not go into the very details of model selection, and will just use the <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/Merlion\" rel=\"noopener\">Merlion</a> library, an excellent open-source time series analysis package developed by Salesforce.<br><br>Merlion implements an end-to-end machine learning framework, that includes loading and transforming data, building and training models, post-processing model outputs, and evaluating model performance. It supports various time series learning tasks, including forecasting, anomaly detection, and change point detection.<br><br>Start by first splitting the dataset into training and test data. The exercise will use unsupervised learning, so you want to train the model on data without anomalies, and then check whether it is able to detect the anomalies in the test data. The data will be split at 2013-12-15.</p>\n{% module_block module \"widget_f35af293-f84c-4fc9-819c-26337f69984c\" %}{% module_attribute \"child_css\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}{}{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"code\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}\"<pre><code>from merlion.utils import TimeSeries\\ntrain_data = TimeSeries.from_pd(time_series[time_series.index &lt; pd.to_datetime('2013-12-15')])\\ntest_data = TimeSeries.from_pd(time_series[time_series.index &gt;= pd.to_datetime('2013-12-15')])\\n</code></pre>\"{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"css\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}{}{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"definition_id\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}null{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"field_types\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}{\"code\":\"richtext\",\"language\":\"choice\",\"line_wraps\":\"boolean\",\"margin_after_module\":\"number\",\"show_copy_button\":\"boolean\",\"show_line_numbers\":\"boolean\"}{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"label\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}null{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"module_id\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}111341816899{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"path\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}\"/sf2-crate/modules/Code Block\"{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"schema_version\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}2{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"show_copy_button\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}true{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"show_line_numbers\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}true{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"smart_objects\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}null{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"smart_type\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}\"NOT_SMART\"{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"tag\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}\"module\"{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"type\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}\"module\"{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% module_attribute \"wrap_field_tag\" is_json=\"true\" %}{% raw %}\"div\"{% endraw %}{% end_module_attribute %}{% end_module_block %}\n<p><img src=\"https://cratedb.com/hubfs/Screenshot%202023-09-22%20at%2009.52.44.png\" width=\"2032\" height=\"1160\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Machine Learning for Time Series Data\" style=\"height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 2032px;\"></p>\n<p>Now, train the model using the Merlion <code>DefaultDetector</code>, which is an anomaly detection model that balances performance and efficiency.
